## The gut microbiota and well-being during pregnancy

Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden

### Background: 

Stress during pregnancy raises concerns due to its potential impact on maternal and fetal health. The gut microbiota (GM) is linked to various physiological functions, acting as a potential mediator in the relationship between pregnancy stress and the risk of depression. Over the years, the role of the GM in the bidirectional communication along the gutâ€“brain axis, and subsequent changes in behaviour, suggesting that stress can lead to long-term changes in the GM. 

### Aims: 

To investigate the association between stress during both early and late pregnancy and alteration in the GM composition in the non-depressed pregnant women. 

### Materials & Methods: 

All data were obtained and statistically analysed through the Centre for Translational Microbiome Research server (CTMR). Metadata included the extensive variables and confounders for 5446 pregnant women. Participants with the gestational week of 11 to 18 and 26 to 32, respectively as the timepoint 1 and 2 were selected, along with various variables with potential impact on stress or gut microbiota composition for the bioinformatic and statistical analysis process. Correlation tests and general linear modelling were used for quantitative data, while t-tests were applied to qualitative data. Taxonomically classified raw sequencing reads for the collected faecal samples were also used to investigate within-sample diversity and between-sample diversity.

### Results: 

For the timepoint 1 and 2, 596 and 551 individuals met filtration criteria on metadata and had faecal samples sequenced results, respectively. In terms of within-sample diversity for both timepoints, no correlation between stress and alteration in GM composition were observed. Application of the Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction 2 for between-sample diversity measurement also indicated no significance alteration in GM composition and stress during either of the timepoints in the non-depressed pregnant women in this cohort study.

### Conclusions: 

Contradictory result from this project compared to other studies, highlights the complexity of the association between GM composition and stress. Potential reasons include the impact of pregnancy-induced metabolic and hormonal changes on GM composition, as well as the overrepresentation of participants with high socioeconomic status. The study also highlights the lack of determination regarding stress exposure duration and sampling time, further contributing to the contradictory findings.
